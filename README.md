# Gamebot
A simple bot for playing tic tac toe in Discord servers, running on Node.js.

## Installation
This bot was designed with python3.8 in mind. If you do not have python 3.8 installed locally, you will need to install 
it. The best way is to install it through [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). I also highly recommend installing
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Ultimately this will be running in a Docker container.
