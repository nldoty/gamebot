# Gamebot
A simple bot for playing tic tac toe in Discord servers, running on Node.js.

## Installation
This bot was designed with python3.8 in mind. If you do not have python 3.8 installed locally, you will need to install 
it. The best way is to install it through [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). I also highly recommend installing
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html).

If you are running macOS, you can install via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### Install pyenv:
```commandline
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

### Install python3.8:
```commandline
pyenv install 3.8.0
pyenv local 3.8.0
```

### Install virtualenv:
```commandline
pip3 install virtualenv
```
